# accounts.py Module Design

This module is designed to manage a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. Below is a detailed outline of the `Account` class and its associated methods.

## Module: accounts.py

### Class: Account

#### Attributes:
- `account_id: str`: Unique identifier for the account.
- `balance: float`: Current cash balance in the account.
- `initial_deposit: float`: Initial amount of money deposited to calculate profit/loss.
- `portfolio: dict`: Dictionary holding symbols and their quantities owned by the user. Example: `{'AAPL': 10, 'TSLA': 5}`
- `transactions: list`: List of transactions recorded in the account. Each transaction can be represented as a tuple containing (action, symbol, quantity, price).

#### Methods:

- `__init__(self, account_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
  - Initializes a new account with a given ID and an initial deposit amount.
  - Sets the initial balance and portfolio, and records the initial deposit as a transaction.
  
- `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
  - Increases the account balance by the specified deposit amount and records the transaction.

- `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
  - Attempts to withdraw the specified amount from the account balance.
  - Ensures the withdrawal does not result in a negative balance.
  - Returns `True` if the withdrawal is successful, otherwise `False`.
  
- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
  - Buys a specified quantity of shares for the given symbol.
  - Fetches the current price using `get_share_price(symbol)`.
  - Ensures the user has sufficient funds and records the transaction if successful.
  - Returns `True` if the purchase is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
  - Sells a specified quantity of shares for the given symbol.
  - Ensures the user has sufficient shares and records the transaction if successful.
  - Fetches the current price using `get_share_price(symbol)`.
  - Returns `True` if the sale is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
  - Calculates the current total value of all shares in the portfolio using the latest share prices.
  - Returns the total portfolio value.

- `get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`
  - Computes the net profit or loss by comparing the current portfolio value and account balance with the initial deposit.

- `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
  - Returns a copy of the portfolio dictionary representing current holdings and their quantities.

- `list_transactions(self) -> list`
  - Returns a list of all recorded transactions for the account.

#### Helper Functions (Outside Class):

- `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
  - Returns the current price for a given share symbol.
  - This can be a mock implementation returning fixed prices for testing.
```

In this design, each method adheres to the system requirements, ensuring funds and holdings are correctly managed and validated. The class is set up for easy extension and additional features in future development stages. The module can easily be tested or integrated into a UI due to its self-contained nature.
